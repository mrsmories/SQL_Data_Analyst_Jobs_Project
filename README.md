### **Introduction**

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I delve into the data job market with a focus on data analyst roles. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics.

Check out my SQL queries here: [https://github.com/mrsmories/SQL_Data_Analyst_Jobs_Project/tree/main].

### **Background**

The motivation behind this project stemmed from my desire to understand the data analyst job market better. I aimed to discover which skills are paid the most and in demand, making my job search more targeted and effective. 

The data for this analysis is from [Luke Barousse‚Äôs SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/products/sql-for-data-analytics). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?

### Tools I Used

In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.

### Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question: 


## SQL Files

Finding the optimal balance between skill demand and salary potential


### 1. Entry Level Remote Data Analyst Job
  For the first query I was interested in how many remote jobs there are with Data Analyst in their job title in the 2023 database along with the company names and where the jobs were posted.  I focused on jobs with specified salaries and started at the lower end of the salary range assuming those would be the jobs most accessible to me at the Entry level.
```
sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    job_via,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_title LIKE '%Data Analyst%' AND job_location ='Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg;
```

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
  For this query I wanted to explore what skills are associated with the top paying jobs in the 2023 data set.  As an Entry Level analyst that is still looking to build my skills I am curious about what types of skills are most valuable on the job market.  By first finding the 20 job postings with highest average salaries and connecting to the skills that were highlighted in those postings I want to analyze how many times common skills occur associated with high paying jobs.
```
sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_via,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title LIKE '%Data Analyst%' AND job_location ='Anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 20)
    SELECT 
        top_paying_jobs.*,
        skills

    FROM
        top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN
        skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN
        skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    ORDER BY
        top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;
```
### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.  The query focuses on all posted Data Analyst jobs and narrows down to the top 5 skills associated with those jobs.
```
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
        job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN
        skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN
        skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title LIKE '%Data Analyst%' 
GROUP BY
skills 
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC       
    LIMIT 5
```
### 4. Skills Based on Salary

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
